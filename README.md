Start a new Spring Starter Project and create a package for your controllers

Create a new controller called DaikichiController, and be sure you annotate it as a @RestController

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi' display text that says 'Welcome!'

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/today' display text that says 'Today you will find luck in all your endeavors!'

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/tomorrow' display text that says 'Tomorrow, an opportunity will arise, so be sure to be open to new ideas!'
